What is Docker?

  From https://www.docker.com/what-docker:

    "Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete
    filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime,
    system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on
    a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the
    same, regardless of its environment.

    LIGHTWEIGHT

    Containers running on a single machine share the same operating
    system kernel; they start instantly and use less RAM. Images are
    constructed from layered filesystems and share common files,
    making disk usage and image downloads much more efficient."

Setup (first time only)
======================================================================

Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker

Create container to store persistent user data

  This container will hold a directory where all your user data can be
  stored for use with PyLith within Docker. This directory is not
  directly accessible from your host computer. However, you can copy
  files to/from your host filesystem using "docker cp" (see below).

  $ docker create --name pylith-data geodynamics/pylith-data


======================================================================
Run Unix shell within Docker to use PyLith.
======================================================================

  $ docker run -ti --volumes-from pylith-data geodynamics/pylith

  To enable use of GUI applications, like iceweasel (Firefox), use

  Linux:
    $ xhost +local:root
  Darwin (using Terminal application):
    $ xhost +YOUR_IP_ADDRESS; DISPLAY=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:0
  For Linux and Darwin, then continue with
    $ XSOCK=/tmp/.X11-unix
    $ docker run -ti --volumes-from pylith-data -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v $XSOCK:$XSOCK geodynamics/pylith

  The container includes the following useful utilities:
    * iceweasel (Firefox) web-browser for use with pylith_paramviewer
    * vim text editor
    * matplotlib Python plotting package

  We do not yet include ParaView due to difficulties associated with
  rendering on the host display outside the container. 

HINT: You will probably want to copy the examples from the
  pylith-VERSION directory to the data directory, which is the
  persistent storage.

    $ cp -R ~/pylith-VERSION/examples ~/data

  To "pause" the container.
    Control-p Control-q

  To attach to "paused" or "running" container.
    # Find the container id
    $ docker ps
    # Attach to the container
    $ docker attach CONTAINER_ID

  To restart an existing container after it exited.
    # Get the container id
    $ docker ps -a
    # Start and then attach to the container.
    $ docker start CONTAINER_ID
    $ docker attach CONTAINER_ID


======================================================================
Copy data to/from persistent storage volume.
=====================================================================

Copy data FROM persistent storage volume TO local host
  $ docker cp pylith-data:/data/pylith-user/PATH/FILENAME LOCAL_PATH

Copy data FROM local host TO persistent storage volume
  $ docker cp LOCAL_PATH pylith-data:/data/pylith-user/PATH/


======================================================================
Docker Quick Reference
======================================================================

  List local docker images 
    $ docker images

  List all docker containers
    $ docker ps -a

  List running docker containers
    $ docker ps

  Remove docker container
    $ docker rm CONTAINER_ID

  Remove docker image
    $ docker rmi CONTAINER_ID

  Attach to stopped container with a different command
    $ docker ps -a
    $ docker commit CONTAINERID debug_container
    $ docker run -ti --entrypoint=bash $IMAGE -s
